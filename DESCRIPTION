Description: A visual and interactive web application using RStudio's
        shiny package. Bad quality samples are detected using
        sample-dependent and sample-independent controls present on the
        array and user adjustable thresholds. In depth exploration of
        bad quality samples can be performed using several interactive
        diagnostic plots of the quality control probes present on the
        array. Furthermore, the impact of any batch effect provided by
        the user can be explored.
